## Automated Speech Recognition (ASR)

Primary objective of ASR is to predict text sequences (W) from a sequence of feature vectors (X)
Basic approach is to look for all possible sequences of words (with limited maximum length) and find one that matches the input acoustic features the best.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;W^*=argmaxP(X|W)P(W)" title=" W ^*=arg max P(X|W) P(W)" />
where P(X|W) is the acoustic model and P(W) is the language model. 

In the language model, the input is the previous word(s) and the output is the distribution for the next word. Language model could be N-gram calculating probability:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;P(W_n|W_1,W_2,\ldots,W_{n-1})=P(W_n|W_{n-1})" title="P(W_n|W_1,W_2,\ldots,W_{n-1})=P(W_n|W_{n-1})" />.


In ASR, we can use a pronunciation table to produce the phones for the text sequence. Next, an acoustic model is needed for these phones. 
For the acoustic model, the input is generally the HMM state and the output is the audio feature distribution. We can model the distribution p(y | x) as f(x) using a deep network f. An example is GMM:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;P(X|S=j)=\sum_{m=1}^Mp_{jm}\mathcal{N}(x;\mu_{jm},\sigma_{jm})" title="P(X|S=j)=\sum_{m=1}^Mp_{jm}\mathcal{N}(x;\mu_{jm},\sigma_{jm})" />.




## Feature extractors

1. MFCC
2. Raw spectograms (or log spectogram)
3. Mel power spectogram
4. PLP


For NN based models generally spectograms are used

## Models 

### 1. **GMM-HMM (or basic GaussianHMM): Gaussian-Mixture-Model & Hidden-Markov-Model**


In this setup, the distribution of features of a phone is modelled by GMM(acoustic model). Given a phone, it models observed probability distribution of the feature vector. HMM models transition between phones 
and corresponding audio features (MFCC for example). HMM models how hidden states (phones) is transited and observed, i.e. what phones follow each other.


When a HMM model is learned, **forward learning** is used to calculate the likelihood of observations:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;P(X)=\sum_SP(X,S)=\sum_SP(X|S)P(S)" title="\Sum_S P(X,S) = \Sum_S P(X|S) P(S)" />


where **P(X)** is probability of observed event, **P(X|S)** is probability of an observation given an internal state known as emission densition, **P(S)** is transition probability between 
internal states known as transition density. 


The likelihood of feature given phone is calculated by GMM: 

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;P(X|S)=\sum_jp_j\mathcal{N}(\mu_j,\sigma_j)" title="P(X|S)=\sum_jp_j\mathcalN(\mu_j,\sigma_j)" />.


We can learn the Gaussian model (N) for each phone from the training data.

To avoid exponential complexity in HMM modelling, probability up to some sequence is calculated instead of whole sequence. This learning of transition probability and conditional probability is done via algorithms such as **forward-backward** algorithm.

### 2. **DNN-HMM: Deep Neural Network & Hidden-Markov Model**

In this model, DNN is trained to provide posterior probability estimates for the HMM states (**P(S|X)**). 
Specifically, for an observation, the output of the DNN (**y(S)**) for the HMM state S is obtained.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;y(S)=P(S|X)=\frac{exp(a(S))}{\sum_S'exp(a(S'))}" title="y(S)=P(S|X)=\frac{exp{a(S)}}{\sum_S'exp{a(S')}}" />.

where **a(S)** is the activation at the output layer corresponding
to state S. The recognizer uses a pseudo log-likelihood of state
S given observation X:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;P(X|S)=logy(S)-logP(S)" title="P(X|S)=\logy(S)-\logP(S)" />.

where **P(S)** is the prior probability of state s calculated from the training data.

--- **Fully Connected** : We can use the features from the Mel filter bank as input to an FC network. Some ASR FC models contain 3â€“8 hidden layers with 2048 hidden units in each layer.
--- **CNN/TDNN** : CNN takes advantage of locality and discovers local information hierarchically. CNN is more efficient if the information has a strong spatial relationship. It allows deeper layers and creates a more complex function. Audio speech is time-sequence data. Instead of applying a 2D convolution filter, we can use a 1-D filter to extract features across multiple frames in time. This is the Time-delay neural networks (TDNN).
--- **RNN (LSTM/GRU)** : RNN based architectures to handle time sequence can also be used.

In the DNN networks, instead of using cross-entropy (CE) error functions, sequence training objective functions have been found to be more useful:
- MMIE: Maximum mutual information estimation (MMIE) aims to directly maximise the
posterior probability (sometimes called conditional maximum likelihood).
- BMMI: Boosted MMI
- MPE : Minimum phone error
- MBR : Minimum Bayes' Risk
