## October 1

1. Data Exploration:
- Skewed?
- How bad is the noise?
- How much empty space?


2. Data Preprocessing:
- band-pass filter?
- denoising?
- assume that more data will come


3. Data Augmentation?
- 


4. Models
- We have many classes with few samples (min. 3, max. 12)
- Random Forrest work well with little data
- GANs? hard
-
